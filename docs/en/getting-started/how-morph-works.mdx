## 1. Import data into your workspace

Morph allows users to easily import data from a variety of data sources into their Workspace. Users can import a variety of file formats, including CSV, JSON, and Excel files. In addition, data can be imported directly from cloud storage and databases.

## 2. Build a data pipeline on Canvas

After data is imported into the workspace, a data pipeline is built on the canvas: Morph AI automates data cleaning, transformation, and integration for efficient data processing. Users can build the pipeline using drag-and-drop operations, and the AI suggests the best way to process the data.

## 3. Edit code

Morph provides a powerful editor for querying and analyzing data using SQL and Python. Users can edit code using Morph's built-in code editor, extract the data they need, and/or perform complex analyses. They can also see the results of their code execution in real-time, allowing them to get quick feedback.

## 4. Generate visualizations and reports

Once the analysis is complete, visualize the data using Morph's extensive visualization tools. Graphs and charts can be easily created, and interactive dashboards can be built. The visualizations generated can be exported as reports or shared in real-time. This allows you to effectively communicate data insights.

## 5. Build data applications

Construct custom data apps using Markdown, to interrogate your data the way you wish.

## 6. Share with your team

Morph allows you to easily share the data, pipelines, apps, and visualizations you create with your team members. This facilitates collaboration across the team and efficient, data-driven decision-making.
