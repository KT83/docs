title: 'Job Scheduling'
---

This section describes a mechanism for scheduling and executing data pipelines created in SQL or Python.

Functions such as `load_data` in SQL and `@morph.load_data()` in Python allow multiple processes to be built as a pipeline.
Scheduled execution of this pipeline can automate recurring tasks such as daily sales totals.

As shown below, when you open the SQL/Python file, ‘Run Schedules’ appears in the tab on the right-hand side.
Here you can check the jobs currently set up and register new jobs.

## Job scheduling settings

Job scheduling should be configured for the last function in the pipeline.
The `load_data` function also executes the function to be loaded at runtime, so any data pipeline can be executed periodically by specifying the last function in the data pipeline.

The execution date and time can be set flexibly, such as ‘every day’ or ‘only on weekdays’. The execution time can also be set in 15-minute increments.
