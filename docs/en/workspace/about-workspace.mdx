title: 'Workspace Overview'
---

The Morph workspace consists of three sections:

- **Code:** a VS Code-based editor and a proprietary framework allow you to build data applications and analyse data fast.
- **Database:** built-in PostgreSQL can be used. You can build the data marts you want to use during the analysis process and in your data applications, enabling more flexible data utilization.
- **Connections:** create RDB / data warehouse / SaaS connections and start analysing immediately without writing complicated authentication code.
