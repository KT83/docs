title: 'Development Environment'
---

The Code section of the Morph workspace provides a development environment for building data analysis and data applications.

Every workspace is allocated its own VM (Virtual Machine), so each user has their own completely separate workspace.
Even within the same team, each user has a completely separate VM, so there is no conflict in work. To enable collaboration between engineers, each VM is connected to a managed GitLab.

You can also utilise a VS Code-based editor for executing code and coding on the VMs to build data applications.

The organisation on the workspace is as follows:

## Using Git

Code automatically installs a built-in Git in the VM. Therefore, if you want to share your work on a workspace with other members, you need to commit to Git.

The same workspace is tied to the same Gitlab project, so you can share your work with other members by committing your code.

You can use VS Code's default Git manipulation functionality or Git from the Terminal. Of course, you can also install your preferred Git manipulation extension in the VS Code Extension.

### About the framework

The Morph framework allows you to use a range of tools to analyse, visualise and operationalise your data.
The following pages show you how to build each of these:
