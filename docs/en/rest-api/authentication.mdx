## How to obtain an API key:

1. from the Home screen, press the ‘Secrets’ tab to display the following page.
2. next press the ‘Create Secret’ button, enter the Secret name and Source IP and confirm with the ‘Create’ button.
※If the Source IP is left blank, all IPs are allowed; to restrict the Source IP, enter a comma-separated list.
3. if the created API key is no longer required, it can be deleted from the ‘Delete’ button.
4. press the ‘Delete’ button from the Delete confirmation modal that appears, and the API key will be deleted completely.
**[NB!] This operation cannot be undone.**

## API URL

The URL of the API will be in the following format:

BaseURL: `https://beta-api.morphdb.io/v0/rest/[Your_DatabaseID]/`

**How to check the database ID `[Your_DatabaseID]`**

Within the Morph workspace screen, the database ID is displayed following `/workspace`.

`https://beta-app.morphdb.io/workspace/[database_id]?selected...`

**How to check the table name `[**Your_Table_Name**]`**.

When querying for a specific table in the database schema, the URL of the API will be of the form:

URL: `https://beta-api.morphdb.io/v0/rest/[Your_DatabaseID]/[Your_Table_Name]`

The table name is what you see in the Built-in Tables in the side menu. The table name is also what appears in the editor tab when you select a table.
